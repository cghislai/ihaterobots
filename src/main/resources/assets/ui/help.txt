Hello fellow gamer!

Playing and understanding I hate robots is very simple!

You move around the little red-haired jetter. You goal is to
collect all the green gems. The escape door will then open
and bring you to the next level.

You can use the fire key to break some tiles. But take care!
Some of them might reseal themselves after a period of time. 
If they reseal on an enemy, good for you! But you might get 
trapped as well and die with lots of pain.

If the designer of the level has been kind enough, you will find 
some fuel for your jetpack in simple or double tanks. You might 
also find a refuleling area - the blinking green dots. Once you 
have fuel, you can fly around.

You can also use teleporters - the blinking colored halos. They
will bring you randomly to another one of the same color.

You might have to open doors to progress in the level. You and only
you can use switches, but all moving things will activates automatic
switches.

You can collect gold items to gain more points. The gold statue will
bring you an extra life as well. Otherwise, you get an extra life 
every 5000 points.

There are 2 powerups. The lightning thing will make you invulnerable
to ennemies, while the blue star will stun them for some times.
Take care, frozen ennemies can still kill you!

Change speed with F5/F6 ingame.
